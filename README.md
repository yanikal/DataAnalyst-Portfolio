# Netflix-Movies-and-TVshows-Visualization-PowerBI

This is a Power BI project that creates interactive dashboards for Netflix content visual analysis.

## Dataset
I use 2 datasets
* the first one is Netflix Movies and TV Shows on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) 
* the second one is IMDb score from [IMDb Datasets](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) (note that we use title.basics.tsv and title.ratings.tsv)
then we combine it all together using `data_preparation.ipynb` and the final preprocessed data is in `data/netflix_titles_with_IMDB.csv`

## Results
This project depicts 2 story points.
1. an overview of Netflix content \

# Avocado-Prices-Prediction

1. The objective of this project is to predict the price of avocado sold in the US using historical dataset.
2. Data represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. 
3. The data is as follows:
   Date - The date of the observation
   Average Price - the average price of a single avocado
   type - conventional or organic
   year - the year
   Region - the city or region of the observation
   Total Volume - Total number of avocados sold
   4046 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4046 sold
   4225 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4225 sold
   4770 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4770 sold  

   * PLU - Product Lookup codes 

# Facebook Prophet

1. Prophet is open source software released by Facebook’s Core Data Science team.
2. Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly,    and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. 
3. Prophet works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.
