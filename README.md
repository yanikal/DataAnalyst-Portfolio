Exploration of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Project Overview
I wanted to explore how COVID-19 was impacting different countries and explore which anti-pandemic efforts have been effective in curbing its spread.

Datasets
Two datasets were used for analysis.

The first dataset provides data on the fatalities from COVID-19 across different countries. This dataset was provided by 'Our World In Data' - and is current as at 17/02/2023.

The second dataset provides data on the anti-pandemic measures taken by different governments. It's provided by ACAPS, which is a non-profit project that provides international, independent humanitarian analysis (according to Wikipedia) - and is current as at 10/12/2022.

Data wrangling steps prior to conducting analysis included:
Renaming column headers
Dropping unnecessary columns
Dropping duplicate rows
Convert object header types to categorical datatypes
Convert object header for the date, to the datetime format
Merge data sets
Filtering the data set to only include data for select countries
Summary of Findings
Initial analysis indicates a strong response against the pandemic from all governments under analysis based on their Stringency Index.
Further investigation revealed that not all responses were neither strong, nor appropriate, in successfully controlling the pandemic.
The fatality rates of some of the select countries has been investigated in the presentation.
Analysis indicates that the countries that successfully controlled the pandemic all used lockdowns and strict movement restrictions.
Key Insights for Presentation
The main threads for exploration in the presentation is investigating the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and comparing the efforts of different governments in fighting it.

A key insight found was that both the United States , even though they have higher deaths per million when compared with Australia, a person has a higher chance of surviving COVID-19 in these countries as per the statistics, because the case fatality rates (CFR) are much lower than Australia's.
